<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Markup is the foundation of every website on the Internet. Let&#39;s start by creating a basic markup, then adding a form with fields and a button. It&#39;s important to keep accessibility in mind and utilize proper tags. You can also add classes to easily reuse this markup for other pages such as login, registration, and profile forms, as they share similarities.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The end goal is a form featuring two fields - username and password - and a submit button. Make sure to also include a logo in the form header. Use <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/tujSYRjRAX03ZfoXMKRytU/HyperID-UI-Design?node-id=0%3A1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Figma Design</a> as a guide to determine the desired markup outcome. Focus solely on creating the form at this stage, no additional steps are necessary. Also, include a text notification for mandatory fields that are left unfilled. This text can be animated with CSS later, for now, it should simply be displayed after each input field.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here is the example of the form without CSS:</p>
