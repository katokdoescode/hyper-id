<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Your form should now match the layout design. Time for some programming! Create a method to handle XHR requests to the server for data. Make sure it's well documented, as it'll be used multiple times. It should be versatile enough to handle both POST requests with username and password and GET requests for data retrieval.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Implement a function to execute XHR requests to the server</li>
	<li>The function should accept parameters such as callback function, form data, HTTP method and endpoint</li>
	<li>The function should use a callback function upon completion of the request and pass the response status and body</li>
	<li>The function should not return anything, but handle the request processing via the callback</li>
</ul>
