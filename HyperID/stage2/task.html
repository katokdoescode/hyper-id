<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Now it's time to build the remaining pages of the project. There's nothing complicated about this, as you can find all the layouts in Figma. The only exception is the welcome page, which only requires two links to other forms. This step allows you to test page transitions and consider organizing them into folders within the project.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Build a registration page, similar to the login form but kept separate for future customization.</li>
	<li>Create a profile page with two fields for first and last name, a greeting text, a logo, and three buttons (edit, exit, and save). The fields should be inactive for input and the "save" button hidden by default.</li>
	<li>Construct a welcome page as the main page, featuring only a logo, a brief greeting, and links to the login and registration pages.</li>
	<li>Verify that all four pages can be opened and that the welcome page provides access to both the login and registration pages.</li>
</ul>
