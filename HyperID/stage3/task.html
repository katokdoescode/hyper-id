<h2>Description</h2>

<p>With the markup complete, it's time to add color and position the elements correctly. If you haven't already, this is a good moment to add classes to elements. Classes are commonly used in real-world coding, as they make code easier to read. However, you can use selectors instead if desired. There are no strict rules for using flexbox or grid in your markup.<br />
Use what works best for your layout, as sometimes flexbox may be more suitable for aligning elements in a row and grid for defining explicit columns and rows. It's important to ensure the layout remains stable when adding or removing elements in the HTML markup. The appearance should remain consistent even when adding two more fields or removing some, with all new elements fitting into place seamlessly.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Position all input fields, buttons, and other elements appropriately;</li>
	<li>Center the form on the page and set a maximum width for uniformity across pages;</li>
	<li>Apply colors, strokes, and shadows to shape and background;</li>
	<li>Create styles for UI buttons and link as the buttons.</li>
</ul>
